# Design Goals

The game is about: 

* Investigating the human condition at different interacting scales. small
  groups, towns, cities, and larger political structures.
* Being a good western
  * People can make a difference in a town
  * People can leave town and reinvent themselves
  * People are connected to a landscape
* Exploring the folly of youthful moral richousness
  * Or instead... youthful exploration of morality and justice
* The interaction between various kinds of power. Mental, Social, Violent.

# Rust in the Canyon

Well let's see now, there's before the war which we've only got unreliable
stories from our great grandparents and some rusty relics in the canyons to
salvage. Then there's the war, and our great grandparents stories about
intelligent machines that build more intelligent machines and ended up mostly
fighting each other after killing most of the people. Hard to believe there
were as many people as they say but you know how people exadurate. It's even
harder to believe all the infrastructure the stories say they had. Infinate
electrical power anywhere you want it? Instantly talk to anyone no matter where
they are? They say tearing all that down was the only way to stop the machines.
Well if that's true I'm glad they did it, but it sure is hard to believe and
either way there's weird junk out there no one knows how to use so I suppose at
this point it doesn't matter much. Now we've got towns to build, lives to live,
settling to do.

/*
Open up that paragraph, The ideas are pretty tightly packed, especially
in the first sentense. Establish one thing at a time.
*/

These days there is nothing like what the old stories call a nation (or state
is it?) thought I guess there are some folks trying to say they're the state.
There are plenty of safe and stable cities and towns dotted around this vast
landscape though. A landscape that used to be even more vast! It was changed
dramatically in the years following the war. It's hard to see what they could
have been doing to raise the levels of the sea or change something like the
weather of the whole world, but there is good evidence now of the sea rise.
Coasts are often forested right to the water with dead treetops still poking
their bald heads out of the watter, receding into the depths of the sea,
showing us the contors of the sea floor as if the forest once claimed the whole
area before the water came in. People also say they've dived down and saw the
cities for themselves, and there are a few strange shining tops of buildings
poking their penthouses and roof gardens out of the sea along some coasts too.
I seen 'em.

Here are those folks trying to say they're the state I was talking about.

* **The Librarians**, who are gathering, cataloging, and using the pre-war
  knowledge they can find to rebuild without repeating the mistakes that led to
  the war and collapse

* **The Universal Spark**, a fledgling religious organization still figuring
  out their beliefs while they travel to spread the word and do the work

* **The State of Law**, a still chaotic and not fully unified collection of
  more or less collaborating agencies of self appointed lawmakers, courts, and
  law enforcement

In addition to them, there are of course any number of **Outlaw crews** which
seem innevitable in times of indipendant cities separated by large swaths of
lawless landscape.

## Player Principles

Your aim to see your character express their moral understanding in the world. 

Your aim is to find out who your character really is in this fledgling,
recovering, world and to see what they make of it.

Your aim is to see your character put their mark on the world as it recovers
and to survive to find their place in it.

The tone of Rust in the Canyon can swing from heavy, pesimistic, nhilistic, or
gritty to lilghtharted, humorous, or optimistic. It works best to take the
situations that the characters and towns find themselves in seriously and avoid
slapstick or zany antics, though humor can be good, try to bring the tone back
to a serious and honest examination of the town and the chracters situations if
the humor spirals the table away from that. 

Rust in the Canyon includes themes of survival, crime, violence, oppression,
poverty, religion, despiration, power dynamics, conflict.

# Tuning Your World

The game provides a basic premise and sketch of a setting to play in but the
world is yours and so is responsiblity for creating it peice by peice as you
play. In this section you'll tune the setting of Rust in the Canyon for your
specific game.

Here are some important parts of the game assumes is true for all tables:

* There was an Apocalypse long enough ago that the descendants of the survivers
  are resettling the land.
* There are no nations or kingdoms. Towns and cities are the largest geographic
  political bodies.
* The three organizations (Librarians, Universal Spark, and State of Law) are
  known widely but are not more powerful in any single town or city than the
  town leadership.
* The level of technology and infrastructure known and used by people now is a
  shadow of pre-apocalypse technology and infrastructure.

There is a lot of room around that, and the first step with your table is to
find and define the space y'all want to play in.

1. Choose what's left after the Apocalypse.
  * Are rusty old reclics good for scalvaging scarse or still abundant?
  * Are there remnants of the AI war machines left? Are any still operational?
    How many human agents are acting on their behalf? Do folks know about the
    remaining AIs, are there rumors and conspiracy theories about it or is
    everyone completely unaware?

2. Decide how much power each of the organizations have.
  * Are the Librarians known by most people or just a few? Are they generally
    respected, feared, or mocked? Are members in positions of power in most
    places, just a few, or none at all?
  * Is the Universal Spark known by most people or just a few? Are they
    generally respected, feared, ormocked? Are members in positions of power in
    most places, just a few, or none at all?
  * Is the State of Law known by most people or just a few? Are they generally
    respected, feared, or mocked? Are members in positions of power in most
    places, just a few, or none at all?
  * Are there any outlaw gangs known by most people? Are they generally
    respected, feared, or mocked? Are members in positions of power in most
    places, just a few, or none at all?

3. Decide how much technology and infrastructure has been rediscovered or
   reinvented (or newly invented even).
  * Are there radio communications between cities? How big are the cities that
    have radios and radio operators? How many? How rare? 
  * Are there moterized vehicals and tools? How many people can afford a car?
  * How good are the roads?
  * Is there a telegraph? Which towns have it? How much electrical power is
    there? 

#  Creating Characters

1. Beleifs
2. Bonds
3. Stats

## Beleifs

Write a belief like you would in Burning Wheel but don't tell anyone until you
invoke it. You can change it at any time if you want. But if you wait until a
dramatic moment to reveal it and the change you get a mechanical benefit.

*/

Invoking a beleif gives a bonus

Changing a beleif is putting on a crown like CfB

*/

## Bonds

// TODO when we have a bigger party to test with

## Stats

1. Assign 1, 2, and 3 to your Mind, Body, and Grip stats.
2. Describe your topper (hat), dustcutter (coat, dress, cloak), and grip (deadly weapon)

# Playing the game

/*

Rewrite these phases to be the MICE thing. Towns are a Mileau, they have
event/mystery at them, and characters change while handling them.

so we enter a town with a scene setting procedure

* What's strange and new about this town (in town prep and set the stage
  questions)
  * What obstacle, mystery, or event, threatens the order of the world (per CfB
    mysteries)
    * How are the characters dissatisfied with their role? (set the stage, what
      makes you an outsider here?)

Through play we resolve these in reverse order while playing scenes, making
moves, and having conflicts

Moves: Conflict, read a person/situation, Make and impression, Put in the work.

Need a way to find "clues" maybe anyone can write a clue when it feels like one?
Or every move makes clues. conflicts through fallout, read a person/sitch by noticing things, 

* What new role, or contentment, or despair, do the characters find? making this
  "theorize" move success means you've earned that role in town, fail you
  choose contentment with another lesser role or despair.
  * How do they overcome the obstacle, solve the mystery, restore order? this
    move is basically exactly theorize, success you've solved it, failure
    you've got more work to do.
    * How do they find familiarity or comfort in this now not so new town?
    * Or do they leave and find familiartiy and comfort in the open road to
      somewhere new? These two may be part of a third "theorize" move. How did
      you change the town for the better? failure means it's changed for the
      worse. Either way the narrative is moving on to the next town, with these
      characters or without them

*/

This section **should** be written directly to players. "You" in this section
should refer to a player. I doubt it does. needs editing.

## Freeplay

Much of Rust in the Canyon is played in this default mode of freeplay. It's a
conversation as has been described many times before. For the sake of brevity
and the play test audience who knows this stuff, I'll leave the writing of this
section to later. If you are play testing and you don't know this stuff let me
know!

## Downtime

After a conflict you'll often want to take some downtime to rest and recover, or
to let things cool off a bit. You might even want to do that after some freeplay
too. You can take downtime whenever you want.

#### Stress

When you take more than 21 stress remove the character from play for the rest of
the session. Make another character and introduce them into the story as soon as
you want. Next session you can bring whatever character you want back.

## Advancement

Between towns, you can spend your chatacter stack chips on advancement. Buy
traits, improve stats, boost your base stack size. Any chips over your base
stack size will be lost when you reset to your base stack size when visiting
the next town, so spend em if ya got em.

I haven't figured out costs and such, but take a look at what you've got and
see what feels fair. Let me know how you handled it! 

## Running the game

This section is written to the GM (or should be, it's a draft, it's probably not
consistant)

### Clocks

Use'em.

Whenever someone does something that makes you go "ooh Harston is going to be
pissed when they find out," make a clock named "Harston finds out and gets
pissed." Tell the players what caused the clock and why. This is a great way to
get everyone on the same page about the town and NPCs you are running. It's
okay, and often good, when the players know things the characters don't.

Whenever you think you might want to ask the players "Are you sure you want to
do that?" you might be in a situation where there's some misunderstanding about
the town, the NPCs, and the consequences of the players actions. In those cases,
when you ask if they're sure, tell them what clock you'd start if they did it,
or what imediate reprecussions they'd be risking so they can make informed
decisions for their characters and the game.

Often a clock is tracking the impending trouble that is getting close to
occuring, but it can also be good to make a clock for situations the will blow
over unless their fires are rekindled. A shop owner's jealosy, a rival's (or
lover's) anger. A romantic crush. Make clocks like this that'll give the PCs
interesting and varied reasons to lay low and take downtime other than just to
heal injuries and recover stress.

## The Town Stack

Towns have a stack. It represents the balance of effect that the town has had
on the players and that the players have had on the town.

### What about? And Notes.

Write some "assets" "traits" "feats" "special modes" whatever.

"move x from your stress stack to your character stack" is repeated a bunch.
Let's abstract that out to something like "recover x from stress" or something
