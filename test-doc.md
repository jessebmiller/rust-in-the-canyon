# Rust in the Canyon

There's before the war which we've only got unreliable stories from our great
grandparents and some rusty relics in the canyons to salvage. Then there's the
war, and our great grandparents stories about intelligent machines that build
more intelligent machines and ended up mostly fighting each other after killing
most of the people. Hard to believe there were as many people as they say but
you know how people exadurate. It's even harder to believe all the
infrastructure the stories say they had. Infinate electrical power anywhere you
want it? Instantly talk to anyone no matter where they are? They say tearing all
that down was the only way to stop the machines. Well if that's true I'm glad
they did it, but it sure is hard to believe and either way there's weird junk
out there no one knows how to use so I suppose at this point it doesn't matter
much. Now we've got towns to build, lives to live, settling to do.

These days there is nothing like what the old stories call a nation (or state is
it?) thought I guess there are some folks trying to say they're the state. There
are plenty of safe and stable cities and towns dotted around this vast landscape
though. A landscape that used to be even more vast! It was changed dramatically
in the years following the war. It's hard to see what they could have been doing
to raise the levels of the sea or change the very weather of the whole world,
but there is good evidence now of the sea rise. Coasts are often forested right
to the water with dead treetops still poking their defiant heads out of the
watter, receding into the depths of the sea as if the forest once claimed the
whole area before being consumed by a rising ocean. People also say they've
dived down and saw the cities for themselves, and there are a few strange
shining tops of buildings poking their penthouses and roof gardens out of the
sea along some coasts too.

You choose an independant organization as a group and play as a team of their
agents. These organizations operate independantly of any given city or town

Choose from:

* The Librarians, who are gathering, cataloging, and using the pre-war knowledge
  they can find to rebuild without repeating the mistakes they made

* The Universal Spark, a fledgling religious organization still figuring out
  their beliefs while they travel to spread the word and do the work

* The State of Law, a still chaotic and not fully unified collection of more or
  less collaborating agencies of self appointed lawmakers, courts, and law
  enforcement

* Any number of Outlaw crews which seem innevitable in times of indipendant
  cities separated by large swaths of lawless landscape

Your aim is to progress your organizations adgenda in each town that you visit,
to find out who you really are in this fledgling, recovering, world.

Your aim is to put your mark on the world as it recovers, and to survive and to
find your place in it.

The tone of Rust in the Canyon can swing from heavy, pescimistic, and gritty to
lilghtharted and optimistic. It works best to take the situations that the
characters and towns find themselves in seriously and avoid slapstick or zany
antics, though humor can work well and fit right in when its arrived at
naturally rather than reached for.

Rust in the Canyon includes themes of survival, crime, violence, oppression,
poverty, religion

# Creating Characters

Decide with your group which organization you'll all be working with. Everyone
will play a character that's a member of the same group working together for
that groups goals.

* The Librarians
* The Universal Spark
* The State of Law
* An Outlaw crew

# Playing the game

This section **should** be written directly to players. "You" in this section
should refer to a player. I doubt it does. It need editing. Bear with me.

## Freeplay

Much of Rust in the Canyon is played in this default mode of freeplay. It's a
conversation as has been described many times before. For the sake of brevity
and the play test audience who knows this stuff, I'll leave the writing of this
section to later. If you are play testing and you don't know this stuff let me
know!

## Conflicts

The sherrif has captured your crew leader and is holding them in jail.

You've gathered your crew and a few more who owe you as backup to go get them
out.

You decide to ride in with a show of force and get your leader by any means
nessesary.

You approach the sherrif's office and jail where the sherrif and their deputy
are sitting on the porch cradling their rifles.

What do you do?

Rust in the Canyon uses a standard deck of playing cards and poker chips to
resolve conflicts. This will not only determine the situation when the conflict
is over (who got what they wanted, what it cost everyone, etc.) but also the arc
of the conflict, how it starts, how it escilates, how it concludes. A conflict
can encompase few or many actions. Pushes, counterpushes, feignts, etc.

Start conflicts by establishing with the table what's at stake, who's involved,
and making sure everyone agrees on the details of the situation and the position
everyone's in. Stakes can be questions like... Can you convince the shop keper
to give you a deal? Can you push your way past the bouncer into the saloon? Can
you break your friend out of the sherrif's jail cell?

Every player involved and the GM will deal themselves a reserve pile (which
we'll get to) and a blackjack hand. You'll bet chips from your stack and so will
your opponent. Everyone plays the cards they're dealt. The cards you deal
yourself represent how well or poorly the conflict is breaking for or against
you. Your stats and circumstances give you advantages and disadvantages but the
cards ultimately decide how it goes. If someone escilates the situation you'll
do it again.

### The hand, the pot, and the reserve

So each character has a character stack representing the amount they've got to
give. The stack that starts at 11 chips during character creation. Druing a
conflict every character will be betting chips from that stack into their own
pots. The GM will be betting against them into their pots too from the town
stack as they play a hand of blackjack one card at a time to carve the course of
the conflict and find out where it goes.

So you've got your stack, your pot, and your hand. Then there's your reserve.
This is a face down pile of cards that you can look at and play from for a cost.
There are a few ways to get reserve cards. The main one is that you get a reserve
card for each stat point you have at the relevant escilation level. So for
Non-physical you get your mind stat in reserve cards. Your body stat for
Physical, and your Grip stat for Deadly. You'll get an extra one if you are
prepared for the level of escilation you move into, more below. Some traits may
affect reserve cards.

### By Example

1. Set the stakes. Everyone at the table can freely participate in the
   discussion of what the stakes of the conflict are. Its good to keep the
   stakes simple, but feel free to discuss until you've got it right.
   
   What's at stake is: Do we get away with our leader free?

2. Agree on the situation. Again this is a conversation with the whole table.
   What's the situation? What's the landscape of the conflict? Where is everyone
   positioned in that landscape? What about the position is known to the
   characters and what isn't?

   The situation is: The players and their seven allies have just rode into town
   down the main street in the middle of the night. Everyone's asleep and shops
   are closed except possibly a few stragglers at the saloon across the way from
   the sherrif's office. No one else is in the street. The gang has stopped in
   the middle of the street facing the sherrif's office. The sherrif and deputy
   are standing on the porch of the office building cradling rifels watching the
   gang approach and are ready and waiting for whatever may come. We presume the
   leader is in the jail cell inside.

3. Everyone who's involved secretly decides what they're preparing for
   (*Non-physical*, *Physical*, or *Deadly*) and then says what they're doing.
   Once that's done everyone reveals what they prepared for. The GM combines all
   NPCs that are working together into one hand.

   What everyone is doing, what they're prepared for:
   Sherrif and Deputy: prepared for deadly, waiting.
   You: prepared for non-physical, you shout "We'll be going now with the one
   you've got in your cell there one way or another" and reveal your pistols as
   the rest of the gang reveals their guns and other grips too.

4. Determine surprise, escilation, and preparation.
   * Based on context and honesty, was anyone surprised? Note this, it'll
     matter.
   * To determine escilation look at what everyone did. If anyone used deadly
     weapons or deadly violence to directly affect the conflict, the situation
     has escilated to *Deadly*, otherwise if anyone used their body to directly
     affect the conflict, the situation has escilated to *Physical*. It's
     *Non-physical* otherwise.
   * Whoever prepared for the correct escilation may deal themselves one reserve
     card unless they are surprised.

   Where it escilated, whose prepared, whose surprised is: While the gang is
   being physical with their grips by being threatening with them, they are not
   using their deadly aspects directly. They are also not using them to
   physically affect the conflict (like by hitting someone with the stock of a
   gun). The sherrif and deputy are just waiting, so this is still
   *Non-violent*. No one is surprised by this, it's all happening out in the
   open. You prepared for *Non-violent* so you deal yourself a reserve card. The
   sherrif and deputy prepared for *Deadly* so the GM does not deal themself a
   reserve card.

5. Everyone deals themself reserve cards based on surprise, stats, and
   escilation. Anyone surprised doesn't deal any reserve cards. Players deal
   reserve cards equal to the stat associated with the escilation.
   *Mind* for *Non-violent*
   *Body* for *Physical*
   *Grip* for *Deadly*
   The GM deals themself reserve cards based on the rank of the PCs opposition.
   0 cards for trivial opposition
   1 card for bothersome opposition
   2 cards for difficult opposition
   3 cards for serious opposition
   5 cards for overwhelming opposition
   Everyone should look at their reserve cards but keep them secret from other
   players.

   You have a *Mind* stat of 3 so you deal yourself 3 reserve cards from your
   deck.
   The sherrif and deputy are no slouches but you've got a whole gang with
   you, so the GM determines that this is difficult opposition and deals
   themself 2 reserve cards as well.

6. The GM and all participating players ante a number of chips from their stacks
   equal to the rank of the opposition and deal themself one card face up.
   Narrate how the conflict progresses based on who's got the advantage at this
   stage.

   You put 2 chips from your stack into the pot and deal yourself a Jack. The GM
   puts 2 chips from the town stack into the pot and deals themself a Ace. They
   have a slight advantage so the deputy says "I guess you're just going to have
   to test us and find out why we've kept this job for 15 years." but you and
   the gang stay silent and determined.

7. It's still **Non-physical** so there's no escilation. Everyone decides if
   they want to bet a chip. If anyone does everyone else who wants to stay in
   the conflict must also bet a chip. If it were **Physical** y'all could bet up
   to 2 chips, and up to 3 if it were **Deadly**

   The GM has a better hand, and knows that they've got a Queen in their reserve
   hand and can use it to make a blackjack. They bet 1 chip.
   You decide you've got a good enough hand to keep going so you see, and bet 1
   chip to match.

8. The GM places a card from their hand face down for dramatic effect while you
   deal yourself a card from your deck. You deal yourself a 10 giving you 20,
   but the GM reveals their Queen giving themself a blackjack winning the hand.
   Describe how the conflict (at this level of escilation) is resolved in favor
   of the winner of the hand.

   The sherrif and deputy, not fearing or not respecting your threats, stand
   resolute and begin a quiet friendly small talk between them as if you and
   your gang were not there. 
   
9. Everyone who lost the hand now has a choice to make. Do I accept the loss or
   escilate? If you accept the loss you cannot engage in this conflict any more.
   The situation must change dramatically enough to make it a different conflict
   in order to engage again. The winner also has a choice to make. Do they
   accept the win or do they keep pushing and escilate themselves, forgoing the
   win and reigniting the conflict? Everyone secretly decides what they are
   preparing for. The choices now are either an escilation level higher than the
   current level, or accepting the result. Once people have made their
   predictions, everyone says what they do and if anyone escilates, go back to
   step 4 (with a slight modification, someone must escilate to a higher level
   or the result stands). Otherwise resolve the conflict.

   You might expect the sherrif or deputy to come out and make it physical,
   trying to rub it in your face, but knowing them like you do, you expect that
   they'll let the result stand. 
   The GM does not expect you to give up so easy, and decides that the sherrif
   and deputy are still prepared for things to go deadly.
   With everyones predictions made, you decide you're going to walk right up to
   them and just take the key off them.
   You're using your body to physically affect the conflict and so you've
   escilated to *Physical*
   Everyone goes back to step 4 and plays another hand.

### Resolution

When the conflict is over, evaluate the result, resolve the stakes, and
determine fallout.

* If you won the hand with a 20 or 21, you get the stakes with no fallout.
  Put your pots into your stack.
* If you won the hand with a lower total, tie, or lost the hand with a 20 or
  21 you get the stakes with fallout.
  After determining fallout put your stacks into stress.
* If you lost the hand with a lower total, you don't get the stakes and you
  get fallout.
      
After determining fallout put your stacks into stress. Everyone who got fallout
shuffles their deck and deals piles of cards to match their pots by dealing a
card for each chip into a pile for each pot. From each pile, identify the best 2
card blackjack hand and discard the rest. The hand from the pot made during the
highest level of escilation that either wins or ties the other hands is the
*Fallout Hand*. Look up fallout on the appropriate table based on its escilation
level and number. That's your fallout.

Describe the aftermath. Did you get the stakes? How does that happen? Did you
get fallout? How does that happen?

### Fallout tables

#### Non-physical
2-17: You are stressed take 1 stress
18: take 2 stress
19: take 3 stress
20: take 5 stress
21: take 8 stress

#### Physical
2-17: You are tired gain 3 stress 
18: You are minorly injured
19: You are moderatly injured
20: You are majorly injured
21: You are permenantly injured

#### Deadly
2-16: You are exhausted gain 5 stress
17: You are minorly injured and it's mortal
18: You are moderately injured and it's mortal
19: You are majorly injured and it's mortal
20: You are permenantly injured and it's mortal
21: You are dead. You decide how you die, but it's got to be this session.

### Injury, and Death

**Injuries**

* Major:    becomes mortal if left long enough, faster if you're stressed
            9 goes under your stress stack

* Moderate: becomes major if left long enough, faster if you're stressed
            6 goes uner your stress stack

* Minor:    heals slowly on it's own, slower if you're stressed
            3 goes under your stress stack

For each injury you have find the card for its type from your deck and place it
under your stress stack adding it's value to the stress you've taken.

#### Worsening injuries

Bad injuries get worse over time if they are ignored. Others heal on their own,
even if you go out dancin' every night.

At the end of every downtime, and conflict (no matter what happens with
fallout), for every injury deal a single card. If that card is lower than your
current stress, Moderate and Major injuries get worse, they become Major and
Mortal respectively, Mortal injuries kill you, and Minor injuries stick around.
Otherwise they don't. Moderate and Major injuries stick around and Minor
injuries heal. Also do this for every day and night cycle goes by without a
downtime or a conflict.

#### Mortal injuries

Sometimes an injury will kill you if you leave it without medical attention. It
doesn't matter how bad it looks, even a minor injury, if it's mortal, will kill
you. Maybe from a disease in the rusty nail that you stepped on, maybe it's not
such a bad cut except that it's punctured your gut and making you septic.

If you've got a mortal injury it'll kill you if you don't get medical attention
right away. A mortal injury always kills you at the end of a conflict if you
started the conflict with the mortal injury. Make the *Get medical attention*

#### Permenant injuries

An injury of any severity can be permenant but the permenant aspect of the
injury might not be as bad as the initial injury is. For example, if you get
shot in the leg and the bullet is safer to leave in there than remove, you might
have a major injury that once healed becomes a minor permenant injury. That
would be notated as Major (permenant minor) This injury can be healed from major
to moderate, then from moderate to minor, but then no further. Major(permenant
major) can't ever be healed only stabalized. This is something like losing a leg

### Stress

When you take more than 21 stress remove the character from play for the rest of
the session. Make another character and introduce them into the story as soon as
you want. Next session you can bring whatever character you want back.

## Downtime

After a conflict you'll often want to take some downtime to rest and recover, or
to let things cool off a bit. You might even want to do that after some freeplay
too. You can take downtime whenever they want.

Whenever you go into downtime, the GM deals a hand. Anyone whose stress stack is
higher than that hand may move that hand's number of chips from their stress
stack into their character stack. Everyone else may move
10.

### Downtime Moves

When you stop to **Get Metical Attention**:

* If you're treated by a medical expert, they treat you and give you
  instructions like "Stay off the leg", or "take penecilin every day". Start a
  countdown clock (8 for Major, 4 for Moderate, 2 for Minor). Whenever you would
  check to see if it gets worse, if you've followed the instructions (mostly)
  instead tick the clock. Otherwise check to see if it got worse.

* If you're treated by an ameture (anyone else) they treat you and give you
  instructions, but when they do, they draw cards equal to their mind stat (if
  PC) or whatever the GM thinks the NPCs mind score would be. If they can make a
  hand from those cards that beats their current stress (or 12 if it's an NPC)
  folow the instructions above. Otherwise don't make the clock and check to see
  if it gets worse as though no treatment were tried.

This move can only be made once per injury per downtime.

## Running the game

This section is written to the GM (or should be, it's a draft, it's probably not
consistant)

### Clocks

Use'em.

Whenever someone does something that makes you go "ooh Harston is going to be
pissed when they find out," make a clock named "Harston finds out and gets
pissed." Tell the players what caused the clock and why. This is a great way to
get everyone on the same page about the town and NPCs you are running.

Whenever you think you might want to ask the players "Are you sure you want to
do that?" you might be in a situation where there's some misunderstanding about
the town, the NPCs, and the consequences of the players actions. In those cases,
when you ask if they're sure, tell them what clock you'd start if they did it,
or what imediate reprecussions they'd be risking so they can make informed
decisions for their characters and the game.

Often a clock is tracking the impending trouble that is getting close to
occuring, but it can also be good to make a clock for situations the will blow
over unless their fires are rekindled. A shop owner's jealosy, a rival's (or
lover's) anger. A romantic crush. Make clocks like this that'll give the PCs
interesting and varied reasons to lay low and take downtime other than just to
heal injuries and recover stress.

### The Town

This game revolves around PCs from an organization larger than any town, or at
least acting outside any one town's bounderies and culture, interacting with
a town for a time, leaving a mark, influencing it, being influenced by it, then
moving onto another and doing it again. You can use one of the premade towns
included in this playtest packet (is that what it is?), or prepare your own. The
included towns are prepaired in a style simlar to Carved from Brindlewood (CfB)
games, but you could prepare a town however you want. Hell try an OSR module or
something. Tell me how it goes.

#### The Town Stack

Towns have a stack (is this like mystery complexity in BB?!?)

#### Between sessions

The progress or the catching up that happens between sesssions.

I'm not sure yet, but this game seems to be heading towards a place where the GM
does a little work between sessions. Like a faction turn in some other games. I
don't know the origin of it off the top of my head. This gives me a place to say
what the GM does with resources that the players might give them maybe during
downtime moves, with trait moves, or whatever.

### What about? And Notes.

Talk about the Town Stack somewhere

When someone stays they can raise if they want to, but otherwise no more bets.
their opponent can see and then finish out their hand.

Do a "your truths" section like in Ironsworn. How prominent are the AIs in the
game? How much precurser technology is left working? Has the climate change
woken anything ancient in the deep? Ask how weird, how sci-fi, how violent?
incorporate lines and veils there.
