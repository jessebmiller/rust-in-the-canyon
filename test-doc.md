# Design Goals

The game is about: 

* Investigating the human condition at different interacting scales. small
  groups, towns, cities, and larger political structures.
* Being a good western
* Exploring the folly of youthful moral richousness 
* The interaction between various kinds of power. Mental, Social, Violent.

# Rust in the Canyon

Well let's see now, there's before the war which we've only got unreliable
stories from our great grandparents and some rusty relics in the canyons to
salvage. Then there's the war, and our great grandparents stories about
intelligent machines that build more intelligent machines and ended up mostly
fighting each other after killing most of the people. Hard to believe there
were as many people as they say but you know how people exadurate. It's even
harder to believe all the infrastructure the stories say they had. Infinate
electrical power anywhere you want it? Instantly talk to anyone no matter where
they are? They say tearing all that down was the only way to stop the machines.
Well if that's true I'm glad they did it, but it sure is hard to believe and
either way there's weird junk out there no one knows how to use so I suppose at
this point it doesn't matter much. Now we've got towns to build, lives to live,
settling to do.

<!--- Open up that paragraph, The ideas are pretty tightly packed, especially
in the first sentense. Establish one thing at a time. --->

These days there is nothing like what the old stories call a nation (or state
is it?) thought I guess there are some folks trying to say they're the state.
There are plenty of safe and stable cities and towns dotted around this vast
landscape though. A landscape that used to be even more vast! It was changed
dramatically in the years following the war. It's hard to see what they could
have been doing to raise the levels of the sea or change something like the
weather of the whole world, but there is good evidence now of the sea rise.
Coasts are often forested right to the water with dead treetops still poking
their defiant heads out of the watter, receding into the depths of the sea,
showing us the contoures of the sea floor as if the forest once claimed the
whole area before the water came in. People also say they've dived down and saw
the cities for themselves, and there are a few strange shining tops of
buildings poking their penthouses and roof gardens out of the sea along some
coasts too.

## Choose a Faction

<!--- Change organization to faction for the 4 choices --->

As a group, choose an independant faction to play as a team of their agents.
These organizations operate independantly of any given city or town

Choose from:

* **The Librarians**, who are gathering, cataloging, and using the pre-war
  knowledge they can find to rebuild without repeating the mistakes that led to
  the war and collapse

* **The Universal Spark**, a fledgling religious organization still figuring
  out their beliefs while they travel to spread the word and do the work

* **The State of Law**, a still chaotic and not fully unified collection of
  more or less collaborating agencies of self appointed lawmakers, courts, and
  law enforcement

* Any number of **Outlaw crews** which seem innevitable in times of indipendant
  cities separated by large swaths of lawless landscape

## Player Principles

<!--- separate aims and player principles --->

Your aim is to see your character progress their faction adgenda in each town
that they visit

Your aim is to play to find out who your character really is in this fledgling,
recovering, world and what they make of it.

Your aim is to see your character put their mark on the world as it recovers;
to survive and to find their place in it.

The tone of Rust in the Canyon can swing from heavy, pescimistic, and gritty to
lilghtharted and optimistic. It works best to take the situations that the
characters and towns find themselves in seriously and avoid slapstick or zany
antics, though humor can be good, try to bring the tone back to a serious and
honest examination of the town and the chracters situations if the humor
spirals the table away from that. 

Rust in the Canyon includes themes of survival, crime, violence, oppression,
poverty, religion, despiration, power dynamics, conflict.

# Tuning Your World

The game provides a basic premise and sketch of a setting play but the world is
yours and so is responsiblity for creating it peice by peice as you play. In
this section you'll tune the setting of Rust in the Canyon for your specific
game.

Here are some important parts of the game assumes is true for all tables:

* There was an Apocalypse long enough ago that the survivers are resettling the
  land.
* There are no nations or kingdoms. Towns and cities are the largest geographic
  political bodies.
* The three organizations (Librarians, Universal Spark, and State of Law) are
  known widely but are not more powerful in any town or city than the town
  leadership.
* The level of technology and infrastructure known and used by people now is a
  shadow of pre-apocalypse technology and infrastructure.

There is a lot of room around that, and the first step with your table is to
find and define the space y'all want to play in.

1. Choose what's left after the Apocalypse.
  * Are rusty old reclics good for scalvaging scarse or still abundant?
  * Are there remnants of the AI war machines left? Are any still operational?
    How many human agents are acting on their behalf? Do folks know about the
    remaining AIs, are there rumors and conspiracy theories about it or is
    everyone completely unaware?

2. Decide how much power each of the three organizations have.
  * Are the Librarians known by most people or just a few? Are they generally
    respected, feared, or mocked? Are members in positions of power in most
    places, just a few, or none at all?
  * Is the Universal Spark known by most people or just a few? Are they
    generally respected, feared, ormocked? Are members in positions of power in
    most places, just a few, or none at all?
  * Is the State of Law known by most people or just a few? Are they generally
    respected, feared, or mocked? Are members in positions of power in most
    places, just a few, or none at all?
  * Are there any outlaw gangs known by most people or just a few? Are they
    generally respected, feared, or mocked? Are members in positions of power
    in most places, just a few, or none at all?

3. Decide how much technology and infrastructure has been rediscovered or
   reinvented (or newly invented even).
  * Are there radio communications between cities? How big are the cities that
    have radios and radio operators? How many? How rare? 
  * Are there moterized vehicals and tools? How many people can afford a car?
  * How good are the roads?
  * Is there a telegraph? Which towns have it? How much electrical power is
    there? 

#  Creating Characters

 Everyone will play a character that's a member of the same faction working
 together for that faction goals. Decide with your group which faction the
 players will be members of.

* The Librarians
* The Universal Spark
* The State of Law
* An Outlaw crew

1. Assign 1, 2, and 3 to their Mind, Body, and Grip stats.
2. Describe your hat, coat, and grip (deadly weapon)
3. Describe your vice (vice, guilty pleasure, what lets you unwind the best)
3. Choose a trait from the trait deck (If I've made it, otherwise do without)  

# Playing the game

This section **should** be written directly to players. "You" in this section
should refer to a player. I doubt it does. needs editing.

## Freeplay

Much of Rust in the Canyon is played in this default mode of freeplay. It's a
conversation as has been described many times before. For the sake of brevity
and the play test audience who knows this stuff, I'll leave the writing of this
section to later. If you are play testing and you don't know this stuff let me
know!

### Basic Moves

When you **Read a Person or Situation**, Bet any number of your chips and ask
one of the questions below. The GM will match your bet from the town stack and
give an honest answer comensurate with the bet. Once you've got the answer put
the bet chips into stress. Take +1 reserve card on any conflicts related to the
answer.

<!--- Maybe this move should use some sort of draw, but a quick one, like...
deal yourself face up cards equal to your mind stat. the GM deals one card. ask
a question for each of your cards higher than the GMs card and take +1 reserve
on any conflicts related to the answers. If the GMs card is highest, ask one
question anyway but prepare for things to turn for the worse --->

These questions need tuning! If you and your group think there should be a
different question on here go with it. Please let me know if you experiment
with other questions.

When reading a situation:

* What's the best route in/past/around?
* What should I be on the lookout for?
* Who's frightened of/curious about/in love with/ wants something from me?
* Who wants to help/hinder me?
* Who's in charge here?

When reading a person:

* What emotion are they feeling?
* What could I do to satisfy them?
* What is their imediate goal?
* Where are they weak/strong?
* What are they trying to build here?

**Put in the Work**

When you **Plan and Scheme**, going back and forth about what you're going to
do, considering many options and eventualities, move 2 chips from your
character stack to your stress stack. Keep moving 2 when the GM says so as long
as your planning and scheming. (Not sure if this is better than just urging
players to go take some action, but maybe it works?). This is super
experimental, if this works for you do it, otherwise forget it.

When you thing **We Would Have Planned for This** then say how you've planned
for the current situation, the GM tells you how much stress it costs (the less
believable the higher cost). If the group moves that many tokens in aggregate
from their character stacks to their stress stacks, y'all did plan for this.
Otherwise you can continue without it.

When you **Send for Help** from outside town, either to your faction,
another faction, or even a personal connection, name the NPC, say how you
know them, and say how you're sending word. Tell the GM what you hope they'll
do and what you're worthey'll do instead. The GM starts a clock with your
hope and your fear on it. When that clock expires, you'll know one way or
antoher even if it's not any of what you hoped or feared. It could be worse
than you feared, or even something you haven't thought of. 

### Resolution moves

When you **Reflect on how You Changed a Town** and the town stack has 21 or
fewer cards left. Someone plays a hand of blackjack (with no betting) against
the town's remaining stack total. If that hand beats the total, those changes
are permenant, otherwise the town will revert to it's old ways not long after
y'all leave, or those changes never quite occured as you imagine them.

## Conflicts

The sherrif has captured your crew leader and is holding them in jail.

You've gathered the crew, and a few more who owe you, to go get them out.

You decide to ride in with a show of force and get your leader by any means
nessesary.

You approach the sherrif's office and jail where the sherrif and their deputy
are sitting on the porch cradling their rifles.

What do you do?

Rust in the Canyon uses a standard deck of playing cards and poker chips to
resolve conflicts. This will not only determine the situation when the conflict
is over (who got what they wanted, what it cost everyone, etc.) but also the arc
of the conflict, how it starts, how it escilates, how it concludes. A conflict
can encompase few or many actions. Pushes, counters, feignts, etc.

Start conflicts by establishing with the table what's at stake and who's involved.
Make sure everyone agrees on the details of the situation and the position
everyone's in. Stakes can be questions like... Can you convince the shop keper
to give you a deal? Can you push your way past the bouncer into the saloon? Can
you break your friend out of the sherrif's jail cell?

Every player involved and the GM will deal themselves a reserve pile (which
we'll get to) and a blackjack hand. You'll bet chips from your stack and so
will your opponent. Everyone plays the cards they're dealt. The cards represent
how well or poorly the conflict is breaking for or against you. Your stats and
circumstances give you advantages and disadvantages but the cards ultimately
decide how it goes. If someone escilates the situation you'll do it again.

### The hand, the pot, and the reserve

So each character has a character stack representing the amount they've got to
give. The stack that starts at 11 chips during character creation. Druing a
conflict every character will be betting chips from that stack into their own
pots. The GM will be betting against them into their pots too from the town
stack as they play a hand of blackjack one card at a time to carve the course
of the conflict and find out where it goes.

So you've got your stack, your pot, and your hand. Then there's your reserve.
This is a face down pile of cards that you can look at and play from for a
cost. There are a few ways to get reserve cards. The main one is that you get a
reserve card for each stat point you have at the relevant escilation level. So
for Non-physical you get your mind stat in reserve cards. Your body stat for
Physical, and your Grip stat for Deadly. You'll get an extra one if you are
prepared for the level of escilation you move into, more to come. Some traits
may affect reserve cards.

<!--- How valuable is that summary paragraph? It's reference a bunch of stuff
that hasn't been talked about yet, and everything is covered later. Maybe a
quick list of the steps first to show where we're going (like an index) but let
the example state the rules --->

First a quick outline of the procedure for resolving conflicts then in depth
descriptions of each step. 

1. Set the stakes
2. Agree on the specific situation
3. Prepare for **Non-physical**, **Physical**, or **Deatly** escilation
4. Say what you do then reveal what escilation you prepared for
5. Determine surprise, escilation, and preparedness
6. Deal reserve cards
7. Ante, deal one card, and narrate what happens
8. Bet or back down, deal one card, and narrate what happens. repeat until
   someone wins the hand. 
9. Escilate or resolve the conflict. 

### By Example

1. Set the stakes. Everyone at the table discusses what the stakes of the
   conflict are. Its good to keep the stakes simple but its important that
   everyone agrees, but feel free to discuss until you've got it right.
   
   What's at stake is: Do we get away with our leader free?

2. Agree on the situation. Again this is a conversation with the whole table.
   What's the situation? What's the landscape of the conflict? Where is everyone
   positioned in that landscape? What about the position is known to the
   characters and what isn't?

   The situation is: The players and their seven allies have just rode into town
   down the main street in the middle of the night. Everyone's asleep and shops
   are closed except possibly a few stragglers at the saloon across the way from
   the sherrif's office. No one else is in the street. The gang has stopped in
   the middle of the street facing the sherrif's office. The sherrif and deputy
   are standing on the porch of the office building cradling rifels watching the
   gang approach and are ready and waiting for whatever may come. We presume the
   leader is in the jail cell inside.

3. Everyone who's involved secretly decides what they're preparing for. You'll
   choose and secretly commit to one of **Non-physical**, **Physical**, or
   **Deadly**. You can do this by writing each down on a note card or slip of
   paper and putting your choice face down in front of you. If you come up with
   another method you like please let me know. 

4. Say what you're doing then reveal what you prepared for. 

   What everyone is doing, what they're prepared for:
   Sherrif and Deputy: prepared for deadly, waiting.
   You: prepared for non-physical, you shout "We'll be going now with the one
   you've got in your cell there one way or another" and reveal your pistols as
   the rest of the gang reveals their guns and other grips too.

5. Determine surprise, escilation, and preparation.
   * Based on context and honesty, was anyone surprised? Note this, it'll
     matter.
   * To determine escilation look at what everyone did. If anyone used deadly
     weapons or deadly violence to directly affect the conflict, the situation
     has escilated to **Deadly**, otherwise if anyone used their body to
     physically affect the conflict, the situation has escilated to
     **Physical**. It's **Non-physical** otherwise.
   * Whoever prepared for the correct escilation may deal themselves one
     reserve card unless they are surprised.

   Where it escilated, whose prepared, whose surprised is: While the gang is,
   in a technical sense, being physical with their grips by being threatening
   with them, they are not using their deadly aspects directly. They are also
   not using them to physically affect the conflict (like by hitting someone
   with the stock of a gun). The sherrif and deputy are just waiting, so this
   is still **Non-violent**. No one is surprised by this, it's all happening
   out in the open. You prepared for **Non-violent** so you deal yourself a
   reserve card. The sherrif and deputy prepared for **Deadly** so the GM does
   not deal themself a reserve card.

6. Everyone deals themself reserve cards based on surprise, stats, and
   escilation. Anyone surprised doesn't deal any reserve cards. Players deal
   reserve cards equal to the stat associated with the escilation.
 
   * **Mind** for **Non-violent**
   * **Body** for **Physical**
   * **Grip** for **Deadly**
   
   The GM deals themself reserve cards based on the rank of the PCs opposition.
   
   * 0 cards for trivial opposition
   * 1 card for bothersome opposition
   * 2 cards for difficult opposition
   * 3 cards for serious opposition
   * 5 cards for overwhelming opposition

   If the players are in a particularly advantagious circumstantual position,
   step it down one level. If it's particularly disadvantagous, step it up one
   level. Remember to take injuries into account when determining advantage and
   disadvantage.
   
   Everyone should look at their reserve cards but keep them secret from other
   players.

   You have a **Mind** stat of 3 so you deal yourself 3 reserve cards from your
   deck. The sherrif and deputy are no slouches but you've got a whole gang
   with you, so the GM determines that this is difficult opposition and deals
   themself 2 reserve cards.

7. The GM and all participating players ante a number of chips from their
   stacks equal to the rank of the opposition and deal themself one card face
   up. Narrate how the conflict progresses based on who's got the advantage at
   this stage.

   You put 2 chips from your stack into your pot and deal yourself a Jack. The
   GM puts 2 chips from the town stack into your pot and deals themself an Ace.
   They have a slight advantage so the deputy says "I guess you're just going
   to have to test us and find out why we've kept this job for 15 years." but
   you and the gang stay silent and determined.

8. Everyone decides if they want to bet and how much. Bets are limited by
   escilation level - 1 for **Non-physical**, 2 for **Physical**, 3 for
   **Deadly**. Anyone who wants to stay in the conflict must match the highest
   bet. Anyone who did may hit (deal themself another card face up) or they may
   stay. Anyone who didn't must back down and give up the stakes, then take
   fallout. Narrate what happens then repeat this step until someone wins the
   hand (ties go to the GM).

   The GM has a better hand, and they're confident in their reserve hand so
   they bet 1 chip. You decide you've got a good enough hand to keep going so
   you see, and bet 1 chip to match.

   The GM places a card from their reserve hand face down for dramatic effect
   while you deal yourself a card from your deck. You deal yourself a 10 giving
   you 20, but the GM reveals a reserve Queen giving themself a blackjack
   winning the hand. 

   The sherrif and deputy, not fearing or not respecting your threats, stand
   resolute and begin a quiet friendly small talk between them as if you and
   your gang were not there. 
   
9. Everyone who lost the hand now has a choice to make. Do I accept the loss or
   escilate? If you accept the loss you cannot engage in this conflict any
   more. The situation must change dramatically enough to make it a
   substantially different conflict in order to engage again. The winner also
   has a choice to make. Do they accept the win or do they keep pushing and
   escilate themselves, forgoing the win and reigniting the conflict? Everyone
   secretly decides what they are preparing for. The choices now are either an
   escilation level higher than the current level, or accepting the result.
   Once people have made their predictions, everyone says what they do and if
   anyone escilates, go back to step 4 (with a slight modification, someone
   must escilate to a higher level or the result stands). Otherwise resolve the
   conflict.

   Some sherrif or deputy somewhere might come out and make it physical, trying
   to rub it in your face, but knowing them like you do, you expect that
   they'll let the result stand. The GM, however, does not expect you to give
   up so easy, and decides that the sherrif and deputy are still prepared for
   things to get **deadly**. With everyones predictions made, you decide you're
   going to walk right up to them and just take the key off them. You're using
   your body to physically affect the conflict and so you've escilated to
   **Physical** Everyone goes back to step 4 and plays another hand.

### Resolution

When the conflict is over, evaluate the result, resolve the stakes, and
determine fallout by evaluating the last hand you played in the conflict.

* If you won the hand with a 20 or 21, you get the stakes with no fallout. Put
  your pots into your stack.
* If you won the hand with a lower total, tied, or lost the hand with a 20 or
  21 you get the stakes with fallout. After determining fallout put your pots
  into stress.
* If you lost the hand with a lower total, you don't get the stakes and you get
  fallout. After determining fallout the GM takes your pots and puts them into
  the town stack.

To determine fallout, shuffle your deck and deal a pile of cards to match the
size of each of your pots. Look for high card, pairs, two pairs, and three of a
kind poker hands from each pile and look up the fallout for each hand. They all
happen.

Describe the aftermath. Did you get the stakes? How does that happen? Did you
get fallout? How does that happen? What do you do now?

### Fallout tables

#### Non-physical

Face or Ace high card: take 2 stress
pair:                  take 3 stress
two pair:              take 5 stress
Three of a kind:       take 8 stress

#### Physical

Face or Ace high card: You are minorly injured
Pair:                  You are moderatly injured
Two pair:              You are majorly injured
Three of a kind:       You are majorly injured (permenant minor)

#### Deadly

Face or Ace high card:       You are minorly injured (mortal)
Pair:                        You are moderately injured (permenant minor, mortal)
Two pair:                    You are majorly injured (permenant moderate, moratl)
Three of a kind:             You are majorly injured (permenant major, mortal)
Face or Ace three of a kind: You are dead. You decide howi and when you die, but it's got to be this session.

### Injury, and Death

**Injuries**

For each injury you have find the card for its type from your deck and place it
under your stress stack adding it's value to the stress you've taken.

* Major:    9 goes under your stress stack
* Moderate: 6 goes under your stress stack
* Minor:    3 goes under your stress stack

#### Mortal injuries

Sometimes an injury will kill you if you leave it without medical attention. It
doesn't matter how bad it looks, even a minor injury, if it's mortal, will kill
you. Maybe from a disease in the rusty nail that you stepped on, maybe it's not
such a bad cut except that it's punctured your gut and making you septic.

If you've got a mortal injury it'll kill you if you don't get medical attention
right away. If you're in a conflict with a mortal injury you must bet double to
see in **Physical** escilation and tripple in **Deadly** escilation. Meaning if
someone (without a mortal injury) bets 2 in **Physical** you must bet 4 to
match and stay in the conflict. They don't have to match you back. Make the
**Get medical attention** to stabalize an injury, making it no longer mortal.

#### Permenant injuries

An injury of any severity can be permenant but the permenant aspect of the
injury might not be as bad as the initial injury is. For example, if you get
shot in the leg and the bullet is safer to leave in there than remove, you might
have a major injury that once healed becomes a minor permenant injury. That
would be notated as Major (permenant minor) This injury can be healed from major
to moderate, then from moderate to minor, but then no further. Major(permenant
major) can't ever be healed only stabalized. This is something like losing a leg

### Stress

When you take more than 21 stress remove the character from play for the rest of
the session. Make another character and introduce them into the story as soon as
you want. Next session you can bring whatever character you want back.

## Downtime

After a conflict you'll often want to take some downtime to rest and recover, or
to let things cool off a bit. You might even want to do that after some freeplay
too. You can take downtime whenever you want.

### Downtime Moves

When you stop to **Get Metical Attention**:

* If you're treated by a medical expert, they treat you and give you
  instructions like "Stay off the leg", or "take penecilin every day". Start a
  countdown clock (8 for Major, 4 for Moderate, 2 for Minor). For each day
  you've followed the instructions (mostly) tick the clock down. If you do
  anything to exaserbate the injury the GM may tick the clock up. If the clock
  ever ticks higher than it started the injury becomes one level worse. If a
  majro injury gets worse it becomes mortal.
* If you're treated by an ameture (anyone else), make the clock as above but
  each day check to see if it ticks down. Whoever's treating you (maybe
  yourself) draws cards equal to their mind stat. If they can make a blackjack
  hand that beats a 9

<!--- This isn't working. I care that characters get injured and that it makes
things harder, but I don't care about the details of the injury healing. I also
don't want to ask the GM to make rulings about when the injury is healed --->

This move can only be made once per injury per downtime.


When you **Get a Good Night's Sleep** in a real bed, out of the cold, away from
the elements, without distractions like someone snoring beside you waking you
up all night. you may move 7 chips from your stress stack to your character
stack.

When you **Take a Day Off** to unwind, describe what you do, other characters
can come along, freeplay a little if y'all want but keep it short (this is just
one move), then, everyone who took a day off, ask the GM what your floor is.

Your floor starts at 0:
* +5 for every bit of work you did
* +5 if you didn't satisfy your vice
* +5 if you were involved in violence (+5 more if it was deadly)

Deal yourslef a hand of blackjack adding the floor to your total. If you bust
you've overindulged and (something bad happens that I haven't written yet).
<!--- what happens?! ---> Otherwise you may move a number of chips equal to the
total of the cards dealt (not the floor) from your stress stack to your
character stack.

### Advancement

Between towns, you can spend your chatacter stack chips on advancement. Buy
traits, improve stats, boost your base stack size. Any chips over your base
stack size will be lost when you reset to your base stack size when visiting
the next town, so spend em if ya got em.

I haven't figured out costs and such, but take a look at what you've got and
see what feels fair. Let me know how you handled it! 

## Running the game

This section is written to the GM (or should be, it's a draft, it's probably not
consistant)

### Clocks

Use'em.

Whenever someone does something that makes you go "ooh Harston is going to be
pissed when they find out," make a clock named "Harston finds out and gets
pissed." Tell the players what caused the clock and why. This is a great way to
get everyone on the same page about the town and NPCs you are running. It's
okay, and often good, when the players know things the characters don't.

Whenever you think you might want to ask the players "Are you sure you want to
do that?" you might be in a situation where there's some misunderstanding about
the town, the NPCs, and the consequences of the players actions. In those cases,
when you ask if they're sure, tell them what clock you'd start if they did it,
or what imediate reprecussions they'd be risking so they can make informed
decisions for their characters and the game.

Often a clock is tracking the impending trouble that is getting close to
occuring, but it can also be good to make a clock for situations the will blow
over unless their fires are rekindled. A shop owner's jealosy, a rival's (or
lover's) anger. A romantic crush. Make clocks like this that'll give the PCs
interesting and varied reasons to lay low and take downtime other than just to
heal injuries and recover stress.

### The Town

This game revolves around PCs from an organization larger than any town, or at
least acting outside any one town's bounderies and culture, interacting with
a town for a time, leaving a mark, influencing it, being influenced by it, then
moving onto another and doing it again. You can use one of the premade towns
included in this playtest packet (is that what it is?), or prepare your own. The
included towns are prepaired in a style simlar to Carved from Brindlewood (CfB)
games, but you could prepare a town however you want. Hell try an OSR module or
something. Tell me how it goes.

#### The Town Stack

Towns have a stack. It represents the balance of effect that the town has had
on the players and that the players have had on the town.

#### Between sessions

The progress or the catching up that happens between sesssions.

I'm not sure yet, but this game seems to be heading towards a place where the GM
does a little work between sessions. Like a faction turn in some other games. I
don't know the origin of it off the top of my head. This gives me a place to say
what the GM does with resources that the players might give them maybe during
downtime moves, with trait moves, or whatever.

### What about? And Notes.

When someone stays they can raise if they want to, but otherwise no more bets.
their opponent can see and then finish out their hand.

"move x from your stress stack to your character stack" is repeated a bunch.
Let's abstract that out to something like "recover x from stress" or something
