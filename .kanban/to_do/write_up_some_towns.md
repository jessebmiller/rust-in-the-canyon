# Write up some towns 
---

Do the 7-3-1 thing on for some towns. Think of these like Brindlewood Bay
mysteries. Give just enough stuff to get the table going.

## ideas

* Redford Kia: outside old Vegas, troubles with minimg claims, secret societies
  working to keep competitors from finding the deep vaults before they do.
* Saturn: Coal mining town where locals are freesing to death. Grotesk
  economics, auctions, and oligarchy, selling coal at higher prices than
  workers can afford
* Bay Aquari: industrial town, working to reinvent steam power. raiders
