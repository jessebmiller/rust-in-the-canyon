## Basic Moves

When you **Read a Person or Situation**, Bet any number of your chips and ask
one of the questions below. The GM will match your bet from the town stack and
give an honest answer comensurate with the bet. Once you've got the answer put
the bet chips into stress. Take +1 reserve card on any conflicts related to the
answer.

These questions need tuning! If you and your group think there should be a
different question on here go with it. Please let me know if you experiment
with other questions.

When reading a situation:

* What's the best route in/past/around?
* What should I be on the lookout for?
* Who's frightened of/curious about/in love with/ wants something from me?
* Who wants to help/hinder me?
* Who's in charge here?

When reading a person:

* What emotion are they feeling?
* What could I do to satisfy them?
* What is their imediate goal?
* Where are they weak/strong?
* What are they trying to build here?

When you **Send for Help** from outside town, either to your faction, another
faction, or even a personal connection, name the NPC, say how you know them,
and say how you're sending word. Tell the GM what you hope they'll do and what
you're worried they'll do instead. The GM starts a clock with your hope and
your fear on it. When that clock expires, you'll know one way or antoher even
if it's not any of what you hoped or feared. It could be worse than you feared,
or even something you haven't thought of. 

## Resolution moves

When you **Reflect as a group on how You Changed a Town** and the town stack
has 21 or fewer chips left. Someone plays a hand of blackjack (with no betting)
against the town's remaining stack total. If that hand beats the total, those
changes are permenant, otherwise the town will revert to it's old ways not long
after y'all leave, or those changes never quite occured as you imagine them.

## Downtime Moves

When you stop to **Get Metical Attention** ... todo do we need it?

When you **Get a Good Night's Sleep** in a real bed, out of the cold, away from
the elements, without distractions like someone snoring beside you waking you
up all night. you may move 7 chips from your stress stack to your character
stack. GM update clocks appropriately
