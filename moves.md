# Moves

## Basic Moves

When you **Read a Person or Situation**, Bet any number of your chips and ask
one of the questions below. The GM will match your bet from the town stack and
give an honest answer comensurate with the bet. Once you've got the answer put
the bet chips into stress. Take +1 reserve card on any conflicts related to the
answer.

<!--- Maybe this move should use some sort of draw, but a quick one, like...
deal yourself face up cards equal to your mind stat. the GM deals one card. ask
a question for each of your cards higher than the GMs card and take +1 reserve
on any conflicts related to the answers. If the GMs card is highest, ask one
question anyway but prepare for things to turn for the worse --->

These questions need tuning! If you and your group think there should be a
different question on here go with it. Please let me know if you experiment
with other questions.

When reading a situation:

* What's the best route in/past/around?
* What should I be on the lookout for?
* Who's frightened of/curious about/in love with/ wants something from me?
* Who wants to help/hinder me?
* Who's in charge here?

When reading a person:

* What emotion are they feeling?
* What could I do to satisfy them?
* What is their imediate goal?
* Where are they weak/strong?
* What are they trying to build here?

When you **Put in the Work** ... <!--- write this --->

When you **Plan and Scheme**, going back and forth about what you're going to
do, considering many options and eventualities, move 2 chips from your
character stack to your stress stack. Keep moving 2 when the GM says so as long
as your planning and scheming. (Not sure if this is better than just urging
players to go take some action, but maybe it works?). This is super
experimental, if this works for you do it, otherwise forget it.

When you thing **We Would Have Planned for This** then say how you've planned
for the current situation, the GM tells you how much stress it costs (the less
believable the higher cost). If the group moves that many tokens in aggregate
from their character stacks to their stress stacks, y'all did plan for this.
Otherwise you can continue without it.

When you **Send for Help** from outside town, either to your faction,
another faction, or even a personal connection, name the NPC, say how you
know them, and say how you're sending word. Tell the GM what you hope they'll
do and what you're worthey'll do instead. The GM starts a clock with your
hope and your fear on it. When that clock expires, you'll know one way or
antoher even if it's not any of what you hoped or feared. It could be worse
than you feared, or even something you haven't thought of. 

## Resolution moves

When you **Reflect on how You Changed a Town** and the town stack has 21 or
fewer cards left. Someone plays a hand of blackjack (with no betting) against
the town's remaining stack total. If that hand beats the total, those changes
are permenant, otherwise the town will revert to it's old ways not long after
y'all leave, or those changes never quite occured as you imagine them.

## Downtime Moves

When you stop to **Get Metical Attention**:

* If you're treated by a medical expert, they treat you and give you
  instructions like "Stay off the leg", or "take penecilin every day". Start a
  countdown clock (8 for Major, 4 for Moderate, 2 for Minor). For each day

  you've followed the instructions (mostly) tick the clock down. If you do
  anything to exaserbate the injury the GM may tick the clock up. If the clock
  ever ticks higher than it started the injury becomes one level worse. If a
  majro injury gets worse it becomes mortal.
* If you're treated by an ameture (anyone else), make the clock as above but
  each day check to see if it ticks down. Whoever's treating you (maybe
  yourself) draws cards equal to their mind stat. If they can make a blackjack
  hand that beats a 9

<!--- This isn't working. I care that characters get injured and that it makes
things harder, but I don't care about the details of the injury healing. I also
don't want to ask the GM to make rulings about when the injury is healed --->

This move can only be made once per injury per downtime.

When you **Get a Good Night's Sleep** in a real bed, out of the cold, away from
the elements, without distractions like someone snoring beside you waking you
up all night. you may move 7 chips from your stress stack to your character
stack. GM update clocks appropriately

When you **Take a Day Off** to unwind, describe what you do, other characters
can come along, play a little scene if y'all want but keep it tight (this is
just one move), then, everyone who took a day off, ask the GM what your floor
is.

Your floor starts at 0:
* +5 for every bit of work you did
* +5 if you didn't satisfy your vice
* +5 if you were involved in violence (+5 more if it was deadly)

Deal yourslef a hand of blackjack adding the floor to your total. If you bust
you've overindulged and (something bad happens that I haven't written yet).
<!--- what happens?! ---> Otherwise you may move a number of chips equal to the
total of the cards dealt (not the floor) from your stress stack to your
character stack. GM update clocks appropriately. <!--- Sometimes the situation
won't let you take a day off. Someone is out to get you and they might find you
out on your day off. How should we account for this? Does the GM just make a
call that circumstances force you into violence or deadly violence? The larger
question here is "What tools can I give the GM for deciding when to initiate a
conflict (whether they are taking the day off or not)?"

This sounds like CfB conditions! Let's just do that.
