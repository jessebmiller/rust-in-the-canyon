# Conflicts

The sherrif has captured your crew leader and is holding them in jail.

You've gathered the crew, and a few more who owe you, to go get them out.

You decide to ride in with a show of force and get your leader by any means
nessesary.

You approach the sherrif's office and jail where the sherrif and their deputy
are sitting on the porch cradling their rifles.

What do you do?

Rust in the Canyon uses a standard deck of playing cards and poker chips to
resolve conflicts. This will not only determine the situation when the conflict
is over (who got what they wanted, what it cost everyone, etc.) but also the arc
of the conflict, how it starts, how it escilates, how it concludes. A conflict
can encompase few or many actions. Pushes, counters, feignts, etc.

Start conflicts by establishing with the table what's at stake and who's involved.
Make sure everyone agrees on the details of the situation and the position
everyone's in. Stakes can be questions like... Can you convince the shop keper
to give you a deal? Can you push your way past the bouncer into the saloon? Can
you break your friend out of the sherrif's jail cell?

Every player involved and the GM will deal themselves a reserve pile (which
we'll get to) and a blackjack hand. You'll bet chips from your stack and so
will your opponent. Everyone plays the cards they're dealt. The cards represent
how well or poorly the conflict is breaking for or against you. Your stats and
circumstances give you advantages and disadvantages but the cards ultimately
decide how it goes. If someone escilates the situation you'll do it again.

## The hand, the pot, and the reserve

So each character has a character stack representing the amount they've got to
give. The stack that starts at 11 chips during character creation. Druing a
conflict every character will be betting chips from that stack into their own
pots. The GM will be betting against them into their pots too from the town
stack as they play a hand of blackjack one card at a time to carve the course
of the conflict and find out where it goes.

So you've got your stack, your pot, and your hand. Then there's your reserve.
This is a face down pile of cards that you can look at and play from for a
cost. There are a few ways to get reserve cards. The main one is that you get a
reserve card for each stat point you have at the relevant escilation level. So
for Non-physical you get your mind stat in reserve cards. Your body stat for
Physical, and your Grip stat for Deadly. You'll get an extra one if you are
prepared for the level of escilation you move into, more to come. Some traits
may affect reserve cards.

<!--- How valuable is that summary paragraph? It's reference a bunch of stuff
that hasn't been talked about yet, and everything is covered later. Maybe a
quick list of the steps first to show where we're going (like an index) but let
the example state the rules --->

First a quick outline of the procedure for resolving conflicts then in depth
descriptions of each step. 

1. Set the stakes
2. Agree on the specific situation
3. Prepare for **Non-physical**, **Physical**, or **Deatly** escilation
4. Say what you do then reveal what escilation you prepared for
5. Determine surprise, escilation, and preparedness
6. Deal reserve cards
7. Ante, deal one card, and narrate what happens
8. Bet or back down, deal one card, and narrate what happens. repeat until
   someone wins the hand. 
9. Escilate or resolve the conflict. 

## By Example

1. Set the stakes. Everyone at the table discusses what the stakes of the
   conflict are. Its good to keep the stakes simple but its important that
   everyone agrees, but feel free to discuss until you've got it right.
   
   What's at stake is: Do we get away with our leader free?

2. Agree on the situation. Again this is a conversation with the whole table.
   What's the situation? What's the landscape of the conflict? Where is everyone
   positioned in that landscape? What about the position is known to the
   characters and what isn't?

   The situation is: The players and their seven allies have just rode into town
   down the main street in the middle of the night. Everyone's asleep and shops
   are closed except possibly a few stragglers at the saloon across the way from
   the sherrif's office. No one else is in the street. The gang has stopped in
   the middle of the street facing the sherrif's office. The sherrif and deputy
   are standing on the porch of the office building cradling rifels watching the
   gang approach and are ready and waiting for whatever may come. We presume the
   leader is in the jail cell inside.

3. Everyone who's involved secretly decides what they're preparing for. You'll
   choose and secretly commit to one of **Non-physical**, **Physical**, or
   **Deadly**. You can do this by writing each down on a note card or slip of
   paper and putting your choice face down in front of you. If you come up with
   another method you like please let me know. 

4. Say what you're doing then reveal what you prepared for. 

   // swap the order of prepared for and what they're doing to match the rules

   What everyone is doing, what they're prepared for:
   Sherrif and Deputy: prepared for deadly, waiting.
   You: prepared for non-physical, you shout "We'll be going now with the one
   you've got in your cell there one way or another" and reveal your pistols as
   the rest of the gang reveals their guns and other grips too.

5. Determine surprise, escilation, and preparation.
   * Based on context and honesty, was anyone surprised? Note this, it'll
     matter.
   * To determine escilation look at what everyone did. If anyone used deadly
     weapons or deadly violence to directly affect the conflict, the situation
     has escilated to **Deadly**, otherwise if anyone used their body to
     physically affect the conflict, the situation has escilated to
     **Physical**. It's **Non-physical** otherwise.
   * Whoever prepared for the correct escilation may deal themselves one
     reserve card unless they are surprised.

   Where it escilated, whose prepared, whose surprised is: While the gang is,
   in a technical sense, being physical with their grips by being threatening
   with them, they are not using their deadly aspects directly. They are also
   not using them to physically affect the conflict (like by hitting someone
   with the stock of a gun). The sherrif and deputy are just waiting, so this
   is still **Non-violent**. No one is surprised by this, it's all happening
   out in the open. You prepared for **Non-violent** so you deal yourself a
   reserve card. The sherrif and deputy prepared for **Deadly** so the GM does
   not deal themself a reserve card.

6. Everyone deals themself reserve cards based on surprise, stats, and
   escilation. Anyone surprised doesn't deal any reserve cards. Players deal
   reserve cards equal to the stat associated with the escilation.
 
   * **Mind** for **Non-violent**
   * **Body** for **Physical**
   * **Grip** for **Deadly**
   
   The GM deals themself reserve cards based on the rank of the PCs opposition.
   
   * 0 cards for trivial opposition
   * 1 card for bothersome opposition
   * 2 cards for difficult opposition
   * 3 cards for serious opposition
   * 5 cards for overwhelming opposition

   If the players are in a particularly advantagious circumstantual position,
   step it down one level. If it's particularly disadvantagous, step it up one
   level. Remember to take injuries into account when determining advantage and
   disadvantage.
   
   Everyone should look at their reserve cards but keep them secret from other
   players.

   You have a **Mind** stat of 3 so you deal yourself 3 reserve cards from your
   deck. The sherrif and deputy are no slouches but you've got a whole gang
   with you, so the GM determines that this is difficult opposition and deals
   themself 2 reserve cards.

7. The GM and all participating players ante a number of chips from their
   stacks equal to the rank of the opposition and deal themself one card face
   up. Narrate how the conflict progresses based on who's got the advantage at
   this stage.

   You put 2 chips from your stack into your pot and deal yourself a Jack. The
   GM puts 2 chips from the town stack into your pot and deals themself an Ace.
   They have a slight advantage so the deputy says "I guess you're just going
   to have to test us and find out why we've kept this job for 15 years." but
   you and the gang stay silent and determined.

8. Everyone decides if they want to bet and how much. Bets are limited by
   escilation level - 1 for **Non-physical**, 2 for **Physical**, 3 for
   **Deadly**. Anyone who wants to stay in the conflict must match the highest
   bet. Anyone who did may hit (deal themself another card face up from the
   deck or reserve hand) or they may stay. Anyone who didn't must back down and
   give up the stakes, then take fallout. Narrate what happens then repeat this
   step until someone wins the hand (ties go to the GM).

   The GM has a better hand, and they're confident in their reserve hand so
   they bet 1 chip. You decide you've got a good enough hand to keep going so
   you see, and bet 1 chip to match.

   The GM places a card from their reserve hand face down for dramatic effect
   while you deal yourself a card from your deck. You deal yourself a 10 giving
   you 20, but the GM reveals a reserve Queen giving themself a blackjack
   winning the hand. 

   The sherrif and deputy, not fearing or not respecting your threats, stand
   resolute and begin a quiet friendly small talk between them as if you and
   your gang were not there. 
   
9. Everyone who lost the hand now has a choice to make. Do I accept the loss or
   escilate? If you accept the loss you cannot engage in this conflict any
   more. The situation must change dramatically enough to make it a
   substantially different conflict in order to engage again. The winner also
   has a choice to make. Do they accept the win or do they keep pushing and
   escilate themselves, forgoing the win and reigniting the conflict? Everyone
   secretly decides what they are preparing for. The choices now are either an
   escilation level higher than the current level, or accepting the result.
   Once people have made their predictions, everyone says what they do and if
   anyone escilates, go back to step 4 (with a slight modification, someone
   must escilate to a higher level or the result stands). Otherwise resolve the
   conflict.

   Some sherrif or deputy somewhere might come out and make it physical, trying
   to rub it in your face, but knowing them like you do, you expect that
   they'll let the result stand. The GM, however, does not expect you to give
   up so easy, and decides that the sherrif and deputy are still prepared for
   things to get **deadly**. With everyones predictions made, you decide you're
   going to walk right up to them and just take the key off them. You're using
   your body to physically affect the conflict and so you've escilated to
   **Physical** Everyone goes back to step 4 and plays another hand.

## Resolution

When the conflict is over, evaluate the result, resolve the stakes, and
determine fallout by evaluating the last hand you played in the conflict.

* If you won the hand with a 20 or 21, you get the stakes with no fallout. Put
  your pots into your stack.
* If you won the hand with a lower total, tied, or lost the hand with a 20 or
  21 you get the stakes with fallout. After determining fallout put your pots
  into stress.
* If you lost the hand with a lower total, you don't get the stakes and you get
  fallout. After determining fallout the GM takes your pots and puts them into
  the town stack.

To determine fallout, shuffle your deck and deal a pile of cards to match the
size of each of your pots. Look for high card, pairs, two pairs, and three of a
kind poker hands from each pile and look up the fallout for each hand. They all
happen.

Describe the aftermath. Did you get the stakes? How does that happen? Did you
get fallout? How does that happen? What do you do now?

## Fallout tables

/*

completely rework fallout to be narative rather than mechanical. fallout should
be fictional things that change the character outside the players control.
These fictional things should then feed back into either the phases of play
system or the conflict system. 

Social is the fruitful void? no specific social domain of conflict because
everything is social, everything has social fallout. 

*/

### Non-physical

Face or Ace high card: take 2 stress
pair:                  take 3 stress
two pair:              take 5 stress
Three of a kind:       take 8 stress

### Physical

Face or Ace high card: You are minorly injured
Pair:                  You are moderatly injured
Two pair:              You are majorly injured
Three of a kind:       You are majorly injured (permenant minor)

### Deadly

Face or Ace high card:       You are minorly injured (mortal)
Pair:                        You are moderately injured (permenant minor, mortal)
Two pair:                    You are majorly injured (permenant moderate, moratl)
Three of a kind:             You are majorly injured (permenant major, mortal)
Face or Ace three of a kind: You are dead. You decide how and when you die, but it's got to be this session.

### Injury, and Death

**Injuries**

For each injury you have find the card for its type from your deck and place it
under your stress stack adding it's value to the stress you've taken.

* Major:    9 goes under your stress stack
* Moderate: 6 goes under your stress stack
* Minor:    3 goes under your stress stack

#### Mortal injuries

Sometimes an injury will kill you if you leave it without medical attention. It
doesn't matter how bad it looks, even a minor injury, if it's mortal, will kill
you. Maybe from a disease in the rusty nail that you stepped on, maybe it's not
such a bad cut except that it's punctured your gut and making you septic.

If you've got a mortal injury it'll kill you if you don't get medical attention
right away. If you're in a conflict with a mortal injury you must bet double to
see in **Physical** escilation and tripple in **Deadly** escilation. Meaning if
someone (without a mortal injury) bets 2 in **Physical** you must bet 4 to
match and stay in the conflict. They don't have to match you back. Make the
**Get medical attention** to stabalize an injury, making it no longer mortal.

#### Permenant injuries

An injury of any severity can be permenant but the permenant aspect of the
injury might not be as bad as the initial injury is. For example, if you get
shot in the leg and the bullet is safer to leave in there than remove, you might
have a major injury that once healed becomes a minor permenant injury. That
would be notated as Major (permenant minor) This injury can be healed from major
to moderate, then from moderate to minor, but then no further. Major(permenant
major) can't ever be healed only stabalized. This is something like losing a leg
