# Towns

This game revolves around PCs from an organization larger than any town, or at
least acting outside any one town's bounderies and culture, interacting with
a town for a time, leaving a mark, influencing it, being influenced by it, then
moving onto another and doing it again. You can use one of the premade towns
included in this playtest packet (is that what it is?), or prepare your own. The
included towns are prepaired in a style simlar to Carved from Brindlewood (CfB)
games, but you could prepare a town however you want. Hell try an OSR module or
something. Tell me how it goes.

### Orchard Mesa

Town Stack: 30

The oldest farming community in the world. It's said to have survived the wars
and other cataclysms. It's the only place in a month's ride to grow fruit trees
and theirs are generally accepted to be the best in the world. The flat dry
farm land among The Bookcliffs and the Grand Mesa is irrigated by the Colorado
River by ancient, well maintained, pre war irregation infrastructure. The
combination of land, river, infrastructure, and traditional techniques passed
down for who knows how many generations makes Orchard Mesa uniquely capable of
growing massive amounts of fantastic fruits and vegatables.

In planting and harvest season Orchard Mesa's population more than doubles as
seasonal work becomes available. It's relatively safe as produce is hard to
steal profitibly, and while farmers and farms do produce lots of wealth it's
relatively broadly distributed to the many workers it takes. Even the
wealthiest here make mediocre targets for robbery. There is generally work
available so even if it's seasonal, folks are able to get buy without being
pushed to desparation. Now of course there are hard times everywhere so
trouble, like theft of opportunity or nessesity, does find it's way here. But
that's got to be expected and frankly is understandable.

### Saturn

Town Stack: 60

A far north coal mining company town. Saturn is far enough north that in the
winter, dusk is around 3pm and dawn isn't until 9am. With only 6 hours of
daytime, some shift workers in the mine don't see the sun for potentially weeks
on end, and then only a day at a time. 

Saturn is an oligarcy and company town owned and governed by a triumverate of
mine owners. These three each run a yearly auction, not for coal, but for the
rights to potential tons of coal that may or may not be mined this year. The
first few tons are confidently bid on every year as the mines regularly produce
a few hundred tons every year, but once the expected yield is close to being
sold bids go way down as the liklihood that these tons will actually be mined
this year goes down. Saturn is constantly visited by yield experts tasked with
estimating the next years yield so buyers know when to drop their bids. The
town bustles and bursts to life around auction time but feels near abandoned
for the rest of the year. The mine owners of course don't live here, they are
only around for the auctions. Otherwise they live south in Kroger which is
mighty cosmopolitain in comparison. 

This auction system means that more than 100% of the coal that the town can
mine in a year is sold before the year even starts. Locals have tried to
organize and pool their resources together to buy a ton as a block at auction
in years past but more often than not they couldn't afford any of the
guaranteed coal and ended up buying the rights to coal that they then weren't
able to mine (though they pushed as hard as they could to mine it). They've
been burned by this enough that they've stopped bidding on the tail end tons,
as they're called locally. Many have simply turned to stealing coal for their
families and some are discussion violent rebellion.

A small envoy of miners families have headed south to a Kroger where, in
addition to the homes of the owners, there's also a well known Library office.
They're there to ask The Library for help. Miners have started freezing to
death over the winter or dying from overwork in the mines.

#### Folks Around Town

#### Local Talk

* Yield this year is looking down from last year until more miners can be
  recruited and trained.

* If the miners revolt, everyone will suffer.
* If the miners don't revolt, the suffering will never end.
